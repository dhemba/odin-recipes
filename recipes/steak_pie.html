        <h2>Ingredients List:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound cubed beef stew meat</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry mushroom gravy mix</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef stew meat, and cook until browned. Add onion; cook and stir until 
                tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in mushroom gravy mix and 1 cup of water. Season with Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. 
                Turn heat to low, and simmer until beef is tender, about 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Transfer beef mixture to a casserole dish. Roll out puff pastry to cover the 
                top of the casserole dish. Press edges onto the rim of the dish to seal. Whisk egg and 1 tablespoon of water together in a small 
                cup using a fork. Brush over the top of pastry.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, until pastry is puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
