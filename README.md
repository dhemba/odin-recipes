A simple website of three recipes and a homepage that showcases some of my knowledge with basic HTML including:
1. Adding relative links to pages to connect them.
2. Adding italicisation and bolding words.
3. Adding images(in this case JPGs).
4. Adding titles and headings to webpages.
5. Working with both ordered and unordered lists.
